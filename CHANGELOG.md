# Changelog

All notable changes to `agreely/sdk` (PHP) are documented here. This project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Packagist reads the git
tag as the released version.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- `consentRequests()->list([...])` now accepts a `customerId` filter (the
  company's own subject reference) and a `limit` page size (server default 50,
  max 100), alongside the existing `status` and `cursor`. Returns the same
  `ConsentRequestPage` (`->items`, `->nextCursor`); metadata only, newest first,
  tenant-scoped by the API key.
- `consentRequests()->hasPending($customerId, $documentCode = null)` — a dedup
  helper that reports whether an OPEN (still-pending) consent request already
  exists for a customer, optionally narrowed to a `$documentCode`. Use it before
  `create()` to avoid re-issuing (and re-emailing). A blank `$customerId` throws
  `AgreelyConfigError` before any wire call. This is a metadata convenience, not
  a compliance decision.
- `ConsentRequestRecord` now surfaces `->customerId` and `->documentCode`.
- `customerId` and `limit` also flow through the auto-paginating `iterate()` /
  `collect()`.

## 0.1.1

- Surface HTTP 402 as the typed `AgreelyBillingInactiveError`
  (code `billing_inactive`).
